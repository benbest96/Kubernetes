This Kubernetes setup defines two Deployments (myprofilev1 and myprofilev2) running different versions of an application, each with three replicas for high availability. The myprofilev1 deployment uses the masterb3/website:1.0 image, while myprofilev2 runs masterb3/php-app, both limited to 128Mi memory and 500m CPU per container.
There are also two Services, the first one is canarylb, which exposes myprofilev1 using a NodePort, and the second one  is validatev2, which exposes myprofilev2, allowing controlled traffic to version 2. This setup enables a canary deployment strategy, where v1 remains the primary version while v2 can be tested separately before a full rollout.
